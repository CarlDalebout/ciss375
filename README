Hello Carl, while encouraging to keep up with the great effort I am seeing, I want to acknowledge the work done so far. Just stay consistent and keep learning and of course you would be amazed by how much you have learned by the end of the course. 
Keep up and remember to look at the homwroks while expecting MP2 and of course MP3 to be posted soonest.
